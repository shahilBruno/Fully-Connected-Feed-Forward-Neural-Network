# Fully-Connected-Feed-Forward-Neural-Network

This project implements a feed-forward neural network with backpropagation in Python, providing a foundational framework for exploring and building deep learning models. It offers:

Modular Design: The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.
Activation Functions: Supports common activation functions like sigmoid, linear unit, and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).
Backpropagation: Implements the backpropagation algorithm to efficiently train the network and learn optimal weights and biases.
Error Functions: Includes functions for calculating mean squared error (MSE) (implemented) and a placeholder for cross-entropy loss (for classification tasks).
Flexibility: Accommodates various network architectures by allowing you to specify the number of layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions.
Getting Started:

Clone or download the repository.
Install required dependencies (likely numpy).
Refer to the code comments for customization options and usage examples.
Potential Applications:

Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., stock prices, housing prices).
Classification: Categorizing data points (e.g., image recognition, spam detection).
Future Enhancements:

Support for additional activation functions and network architectures (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks).
Mini-batch learning to improve efficiency and generalization.
Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
Experimentation with different learning rate optimization algorithms.
